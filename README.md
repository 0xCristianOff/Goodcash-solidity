# Goodcash

With the innovation of Ethereum's ERC-20 as a technical standard, the Blockchain
industry has seen exponential growth in the number of cryptocurrencies being
released. We propose a solution to existing and forthcoming depreciating altcoins
that have a value below the ICO price after a significant period of time and are 
delisted from exchanges, leaving cryptocurrency holders with no value. 

Investors affected by the depreciation and unusability of their digital assets can
bur their altcoins and receive reimbursement in form of Goodcash (GCASH), a peer-to-peer
electronic cash.
